# ML in JAVA 
Machine Learning is subclass of Artificial Intelligence; a system that learns and improves its Predictions. 
ML is more dynamic than just Data Analytics. ML can find patterns and creates ML models much master than humans.

## Deep Learning: 
 AI > ML > DL [A type of ML that uses powerful computing resources and 
 advanced neural networks to more-accurately solve non-linear, highly-dimensional 
 problems with large amount of data.]

## Basic 
Data Set: A set of data that represent specific problems we are trying to solve. 
Model: A data structure that consists of various parameters and methods 
		that transform inputs into outputs; includes some kind of training procedure. 
Training, learning: adjusts model parameters based on the data set in order to 
	solve/learn specific problems. 
Performance measure: metric that is used to tell how good model has learned the data 

## Type of ML 
Supervised Learning: 
	learns from examples that provide inputs and target/desired outputs, it can learn 
	input-output mapping, learning is based on iteratively feeding inputs into model, 
	and minimising the error between the actual and target output(cost function) 

## Linear Regression
Find the line that best fits the relationship between the input variable (x) 
and the output variable (y) 
assumes linear dependency between variables y = mx + c 

## Logistic Regression / Binary Classification 
same as linear regression, just fits
